<h2>Navagraha </h2>
According to Hindu Mythology and Astrology, the positions of the nine planets in the twelve constellations of the zodiac and their movements are considered to be quite significant.

The Navagraha Stotram is written by Rishi Vyasa and is considered to be the peace mantra for the nine planets. They are powerful mantras which can pacify the Navagraha and protect the practitioner.
