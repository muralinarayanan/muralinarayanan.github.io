<h2>Brand Valuation</h2>
<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border" style="color:#22b14d;"></i>
We all know that 'Brand' is an in-tangible asset and is hard to assign a dollar amount to the brand.  There is a London-based consulting company, Brand Finance that specializes in putting a dollar value to the brand.

There is an ISO standard 10668:2010 specifies requirements for procedures and methods of monetary brand value measurement.

We have come across a long way to here.  When you look back to the very beginning of the adventures that mankind underwent, it is evident that risk is part of evolution.  Whether it is discovering new oceans and land or flying in the air, we assumed risk.

It is essential that the supporting information for taking risk is from authorized source. Be sure to do your research before taking it granted that the effort you put in the process will work as you expect them to turn out.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it may not - it may all by a chance.
