Those who practice Ayurveda believe 
every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: 
space, 
air, 
fire, 
water, and 
earth.

These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. 
They control how your body works. They are:
Vata dosha (space and air); 
Pitta dosha (fire and water); and 
Kapha dosha (water and earth)
