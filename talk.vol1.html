<h2>To be or to do </h2>
    Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road and you’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go. If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments. Or you can go that way and you can do something — something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?

We (unless you are a humanoid) are all mortal beings.  
We don't know whether there is a "tomorrow" in our schedule.  
So, get your best foot forward and do the right thing. <br>

Is forgiveness yields to accepting something.
We often forgive someone for their mistakes.
While it is good to forgive, does it give them the permission to continue making the mistakes?
