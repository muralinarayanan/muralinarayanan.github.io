Is forgiveness yields to accepting something.
We often forgive someone for their mistakes.
While it is good to forgive, does it give them the permission to continue making the mistakes?

<h2>Memento Mori</h2>
We (unless you are a humanoid) are all mortal beings.  
We don't know whether there is a "tomorrow" in our schedule.  
So, get your best foot forward and do the right thing. <br>
