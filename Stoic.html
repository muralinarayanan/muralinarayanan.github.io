<h2>Introduction </h2>
Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC.

The name "Stoicism" derives from the Stoa Poikile (Ancient Greek: ἡ ποικίλη στοά), or "painted porch" where Zeno and his followers gathered to discuss their ideas.

<h2>Cadinal Virtues</h2>

The four cardinal virtues (aretai) of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of Plato (Republic IV. 426–35):
<ol>
 <li>   Wisdom (Greek: φρόνησις "phronesis" or σοφία "sophia", Latin: prudentia or sapientia) </li>
  <li>  Courage (Greek: ανδρεία "andreia", Latin: fortitudo) </li>
   <li> Justice (Greek: δικαιοσύνη "dikaiosyne", Latin: iustitia) </li>
  <li>  Temperance (Greek: σωφροσύνη "sophrosyne", Latin: temperantia) </li>
</ol>

<h2>Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger</h2>
4 BC - 65 AD
Works attributed to Seneca include 
a dozen philosophical essays, 
one hundred and twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues, 
nine tragedies, 
and a satire, 
the attribution of which is disputed.[72] His authorship of Hercules on Oeta has also been questioned. 

Letters

    (64) Epistulae morales ad Lucilium – collection of 124 letters, sometimes divided into 20 books, dealing with moral issues written to Lucilius Junior. This work has possibly come down to us incomplete; the miscellanist Aulus Gellius refers, in his Noctes Atticae (12.2), to a 'book 22'.

<h3>Seneca's Tragedies</h3>
Fabulae crepidatae (tragedies with Greek subjects):

<ul>
    <li> Hercules or Hercules furens (The Madness of Hercules)</li>
    <li> Troades (The Trojan Women)</li>
    <li> Phoenissae (The Phoenician Women)</li>
    <li> Medea</li>
    <li> Phaedra</li>
    <li> Oedipus</li>
    <li> Agamemnon</li>
    <li> Thyestes</li>
    <li> Hercules Oetaeus (Hercules on Oeta): generally considered not written by Seneca. First rejected by Heinsius.</li>
</ul>

Fabula praetexta (tragedy in Roman setting):

    Octavia: almost certainly not written by Seneca (at least in its final form) since it contains accurate prophecies of both his and Nero’s deaths.[73] This play closely resembles Seneca's plays in style, but was probably written some time after Seneca's death (perhaps under Vespasian) by someone influenced by Seneca and aware of the events of his lifetime.[74] Though attributed textually to Seneca, the attribution was early questioned by Petrarch,[75] and rejected by Lipsius.
